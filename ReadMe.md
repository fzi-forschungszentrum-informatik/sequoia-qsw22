# Evaluation of QuantumArchitecturePatterns

This is the evaluation for the paper "Detecting and Tolerating Faults in Hybrid Quantum Software Systems Using Architectural Redundancy" (link)[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11134344]. 

This work is part of the SEQUOIA and SEQUOIA End-to-End projects funded by the Ministry of Economic Affairs Baden-Württemberg, Germany

## Setup
Install the necessary dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
To reproduce the results from the paper just run the python scripts *Evaluation.py for the corresponding pattern. 

If you want to run an evaluation on new simulation results run the SimualationsRunner.py.
